# EventCentral to Icalendar

The folks at [EventCentral] have a tool for publish marketing and events
calendars on the web. They'll export to CSV. They'll export to PDF. They won't
publish in the [ICalendar] format, so let's fix that.

## Using

1. Edit the URL at the top of `lib/ec-to-ical.rb` to reflect your EventCentral URL.
2. Push to OpenShift.

## TODO

* Filter based on Stakeholder
